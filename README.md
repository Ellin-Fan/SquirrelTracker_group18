## What is it?

Squirrel Tracker Django project (group 18) for Tools for Analytics course

We are two students at Columbia Univerisity, and we have created a Django app which can be used to track squirrels' locations and behaviours in NYC Central Park. The data used in the app was imported from the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data ](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw).

## Main features

The app supports the below functions:
1) adding a new sight
2) editing current sight
3) demonstrate some common statistics about the data
3) a map that plot plot the first 100 squirrel sightings on the OpenStreetMap
