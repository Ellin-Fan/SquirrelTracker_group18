## What is it?

Squirrel Tracker Django project (group 18) for Tools for Analytics course

We are two students in Columbia Univerisity, and we have created a Django app which could be used to track squirrels' locations and behaviours in NYC Central Park. The data used in the app is imported from the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw).

## Main features

The app supports the below functions:
1) adding a new sight
2) editing current sight
3) demonstrate some common statistics about the data
3) a map that plot plot the first 100 squirrel sightings on the OpenStreetMap
