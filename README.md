## What is it?

Squirrel Tracker Django project (group 18) for Tools for Analytics course.

We are two students at Columbia Univerisity, and we have created a Django app which can be used to track squirrels' locations and behaviours in NYC Central Park. The data used in the app was imported from the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data.](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)

## Main features

The app supports the below functions:
1) Add a new squirrel sighting
2) Edit current sightings
3) Demonstrate some common statistics about the squirrel sightings
3) A map that plots the first 100 squirrel sightings on the OpenStreetMap
